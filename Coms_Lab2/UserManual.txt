All files are ready to be compiled and work. They can be compiled using g++ command via a linux terminal (i.e g++ -Wall basen_to_base10.cpp -o basen_to_base10.o). then you can run them from the linux terminal using ./ (i.e. ,.basen_to_base10.o)

In basen_to_base10 you need to enter a 4 digit integer as your first input and a number between 1 and 10 representing the base you wrote that number in. Notice that non of the digits in the number you entered should have a greater or equal value to your base (because then it wouldn't be in that base). You should receive the number in base 10 as output.

In Grading symbol you need to enter a number between 1 and 100 as input. The output would be that number as represented by the grading symbol table provided to us.

In vending machine you need to enter an integer between 1 to 5 in order to choose a drink. You will not receive an output unless you enter a number not between 1 and 5, in which case you will get an error message.
